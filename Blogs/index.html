                    <h3>My Initial Understanding of the Web</h3>
                    I have always taken the web for granted. My initial understanding of it was quite rudimentary—
                    I knew about web browsers, search engines, webpages, and websites, but I never fully understood 
                    how they functioned behind the scenes. Going into this course, my primary goal was simply to 
                    learn how to make a website, which I saw as an opportunity to improve my understanding of programming 
                    languages like HTML and JavaScript. I have some prior HTML and JavaScript experience from my school 
                    education, however, it was very basic. After setting up GitHub Pages and creating my first HTML document, 
                    my perspective on website creation has already begun to shift.
                    
                    <h3>The Simplicity of The Early Web</h3>
                    Something I found particularly fascinating about the history of the web is just how simple it was 
                    at the beginning. Tim Berners-Lee’s 1994 paper, The World-Wide Web, describes how the web was 
                    initially envisioned as a way to link documents together and allow researchers to share information 
                    (Berners-Lee et al., 1994). The early web was purely text-based, and even features we now consider fundamental, 
                    such as images and videos, came much later. The timeline of web history further highlights this progression—
                    CSS was introduced in 1996 to improve the presentation of webpages, JavaScript followed shortly after to 
                    enable interactivity, and Web 2.0 brought about user-generated content and social media in the early 2000s 
                    (The History of the Web, n.d.). Seeing this timeline made me realize how far we have come in making the 
                    web more accessible, organized, and dynamic.
                    
                    <h3>Discovering the Power of GitHub Pages</h3>
                    Setting up GitHub Pages reinforced this for me. Although I had never used the Pages feature before, 
                    I was surprised by how quickly I was able to get it running. The process took only a few minutes, 
                    and it immediately made sense why so many developers use version control systems like GitHub to manage websites. 
                    Due to my underestimation of the time, effort and resources required to build a website, I was initially 
                    under the impression that using GitHub to manage my website would be unnecessary. However, I now realise 
                    how the ability to update a site continuously and track changes in real-time is incredibly powerful, 
                    especially with how many different components can go into a single site. I can already see how this 
                    workflow will be valuable for future projects, and I look forward to working with it more.
                    
                    <h3>The Impact of The Browser Wars</h3>
                    Another aspect of web history that caught my attention was the browser wars. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, 
                    companies like Microsoft and Netscape competed to dominate the browser market. Internet Explorer ultimately won that battle, 
                    but the introduction of new competitors, like Firefox and Chrome, reshaped the landscape once again (Popular Mechanics, 2019). 
                    This period of competition led to rapid advancements in browser capabilities, which significantly influenced how websites are 
                    built today. Thinking about this in relation to my own experience, it’s remarkable how much easier web development has become. 
                    Modern browsers now support a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it possible to create highly 
                    interactive and responsive websites with relatively little effort.
                    
                    <h3>The Future of the Web: Where Do We Go from Here?</h3>
                    Looking ahead, I find myself wondering what the future of the web holds. AI has already become deeply 
                    integrated into search engine optimization and targeted advertising, making content delivery more precise 
                    than ever before. Could AI one day be so advanced that any user can instantly find exactly what they need with near-perfect accuracy? 
                    The web has evolved at an astonishing pace over the past 35 years, and it will be exciting to see how emerging technologies continue to shape it.
                    
                    <h3>My Goals for Learning Web Development</h3>
                    Through this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of how websites are structured and organized behind the scenes. 
                    I want to explore how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create dynamic and visually engaging sites. 
                    While I now appreciate how much effort goes into even the simplest webpages, I also recognize how accessible 
                    web development has become. With the right tools and resources, anyone can build something meaningful on the web, 
                    and I am eager to continue learning and creating.

            <h2>2&#93 Who Controls the Web? Ownership, Accessibility, and My Approach to Website Design</h2>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-24">24 February</time>
                <p>
                    After reading Stuart Moulthrop’s ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media’, I couldn’t help 
                    but think about how different the web has become from what it was originally intended to be. Hypertext was meant 
                    to be a decentralized and interactive system where users had full control over how information was linked and 
                    structured. But today, the internet feels more like a controlled space where corporations dictate what we see, 
                    how we engage with content, and ultimately, how we experience the web.
                    
                    I feel as though I see this happening everywhere. Social media platforms, search engines, and paywalls all 
                    limit our ability to freely access and connect information. Sure, we can create content, but we don’t really 
                    control how it's distributed. If I were to write something insightful and valuable on my personal website, 
                    and a major news corporation wrote about the same topic, my post would be buried under algorithm-driven results 
                    that favour big-name companies. It’s frustrating because it makes me wonder—has the web truly made information 
                    more accessible, or has it just given the illusion of accessibility while quietly being manipulated by those in power?
                    
                    To an extent, I feel that both statements are true. The web has made information significantly more accessible 
                    than in the past, as people no longer need to search through physical books, newspaper articles, or documents 
                    to find specific information, and, with websites like Wikipedia, Fandom and Reddit users are able to publish, 
                    share and edit information with any other person around the world. However, information that may be more relevant 
                    and specific to a user’s request is often buried under larger corporations’ websites.
                    
                    Thinking about this made me really consider how I want to structure my own website. If I have control over my 
                    small space on the web, I want to do it in a way that makes information clear, accessible, and easy to navigate. 
                    That’s why I decided on five primary folders to organize my website: blogs, images, pages, scripts, and styles.
                    
                    Blogs Folder: I debated whether to keep all blog posts on a single dynamic page or separate them into individual 
                    pages. I’m leaning towards individual pages because it keeps things more organized and makes URLs more user-friendly. 
                    If a user is on a particular blog, the name of that blog will show up in the URL, making navigation clearer.
                    Images Folder: This will contain all images used on my website, with subfolders for each page to keep things tidy.
                    Pages Folder: This is for the core HTML files for non-blog content.
                    Scripts Folder: Where I’ll keep JavaScript files to add interactivity.
                    Styles Folder: For all CSS styles, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the site.
                    
                    I really want my website to reflect my control over the content, unlike social media platforms that decide what 
                    users see based on hidden algorithms.
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="/Blogs/Images/Wireframe_B2.png" width="600" height="450" alt="Homepage Wireframe" />
                        <figcaption>Homepage Wireframe</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    Since my website will be CV/portfolio-based, I want it to be simple but engaging. I’m placing my name or logo 
                    at the top, followed by buttons linking to key areas: my game development portfolio, blog, about me page, 
                    and contact section. To the right, I’ll include links to my relevant social media profiles.
                    
                    One of the things I admire in the websites that inspired me, like Josh Comeau’s, Brittany Chiang’s, 
                    and Adham Dannaway’s, is their ability to present a lot of information without overwhelming the user. 
                    These sites include so much content, but through clever use of layout, animations, and static vs. dynamic elements, 
                    they make it incredibly easy to navigate.
                    
                    I particularly love how static images are placed in the background while text smoothly animates in as the user scrolls. 
                    It gives a sense of movement and engagement without feeling overdone. I also plan to include a floating button that 
                    allows users to quickly return to the top of the page—something I’ve found very helpful on other sites.
            
                    For me, interaction on the web isn’t just about flashy animations or dynamic pages—it’s about accessibility. 
                    The ability to interact with a website means little if people with disabilities or other limitations cannot access it. 
                    I’ve been thinking a lot about how different people experience the web. Someone who is blind, deaf, or has physical 
                    disabilities may struggle to navigate a poorly designed website.
                    
                    Even age restrictions play a role. A child trying to access certain educational resources might be blocked due to arbitrary rules, 
                    while older adults unfamiliar with modern web design may struggle with overly complicated interfaces. These are all factors I need 
                    to consider while building my site—ensuring that my content is accessible to as many users as possible.
                    
                    Moulthrop’s essay made me realize how much control we’ve given up in the digital space. The web was supposed to be a place 
                    where information was freely shared, yet we’ve accepted an ecosystem where corporations control our interactions, visibility, 
                    and access. While I can’t change the entire internet, I can at least make sure my small part of it remains as open, accessible, and user-driven as possible.
                    
                    I also want to make my website a true reflection of me, not just another page lost in the sea of corporate-controlled content. 
                    Maybe that’s the first step in pushing back against the systems that have taken over. But I don’t know if that’s just me.

            <h2>3&#93 Designing for Impact: Creating an Intuitive and Accessible Portfolio Website</h2>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-03">3 March</time>
                <p>
                        For my portfolio website, my primary target audience is potential employers. The main goal is to make it easy for them 
                        to navigate the site and quickly access relevant information about my skills, background, and education. To achieve this, 
                        the site will have a minimal and sleek design, using simple fonts, structured layouts, and a good amount of white 
                        space to prevent clutter. A clean and professional aesthetic ensures that the focus remains on my content without overwhelming the user. 
                        Since potential employers are often looking for specific qualifications or experience, it is crucial that all key 
                        information is easily accessible and clearly presented without unnecessary distractions.
                        
                        The website will primarily contain text, with images showcasing my designs and a professional picture of myself. 
                        It will consist of the following main pages: a home page that serves as the entry point, providing an overview of my site; 
                        an about me page containing details about my education, skills, and professional background; a designs page displaying my portfolio pieces, 
                        highlighting my creative and technical abilities; a blogs page featuring all the blogs that I would have written over the span of the 
                        course ;and a contact page that provides a simple way for employers or collaborators to reach out to me. Each of these pages is crucial 
                        for showcasing my professional qualifications in a structured and digestible manner. Since all of these pages serve a specific purpose, 
                        they must be designed in a way that encourages visitors to explore further rather than feeling overwhelmed by too much content at once.
                        
                        The intended user journey starts with the homepage, where visitors get an overview of who I am. From there, they can navigate through 
                        the other pages in a logical left-to-right order: first, they learn about my background on the About Me page, then explore my work 
                        samples in the Designs section, followed by insights into my thought process and expertise in the Blogs section, and finally, 
                        the Contact page enables them to reach out. This order is intentional, as it first provides essential background information before 
                        showcasing my actual work and thoughts, ensuring that employers get a complete picture before deciding to reach out. To enhance user flow, 
                        I could also implement guided interactions such as breadcrumb navigation to help users track their position on the site, buttons on each page 
                        that direct users toward the next logical step, and hover and animation effects that subtly guide user attention without being distracting. 
                        Ensuring that the navigation experience is seamless and intuitive is essential, as frustration with site usability may lead visitors to leave 
                        before reaching the most critical content.
                        
                        The primary interface element will be a navigation bar that allows smooth transitions between pages. Other elements include buttons for 
                        clear access and navigation, forms on the Contact page for easy communication, search functionality to help users find blog content efficiently, 
                        contrast and readability improvements for accessibility, and alt text for images to assist visually impaired users. I also want to consider 
                        other accessibility measures, such as ensuring proper color contrast, potential keyboard navigation support, and structuring my HTML to be 
                        screen-reader friendly. Making my site accessible is not just about inclusivity; it also improves usability for all users and contributes to a better overall experience.
                        
                        My website follows a simple URL scheme where each page extends from the root homepage (e.g., mysite.com/about). The file names are intuitive, 
                        making it easy for users to understand their location within the site. Implementing semantic HTML has been an insightful learning experience. 
                        By using elements like for blogs, for structuring content, and for date-related elements, I have improved my website’s SEO and accessibility. 
                        Understanding how search engines prioritize content has made me more mindful of structuring my site effectively. Before learning about semantic markup, 
                        I had not realized how much of a role it plays in improving search engine visibility. Now that I have started implementing these principles, 
                        I feel more confident about making my site not only well-structured but also optimized for discoverability.
                        
                        This week, I focused on implementing my blog page while incorporating more semantic markup. Although semantic HTML is straightforward, I anticipate 
                        that as my website grows, organising sections and maintaining a clean structure will become more complex. Additionally, integrating CSS and JavaScript 
                        will be an ongoing learning process, particularly in ensuring that styling and interactivity remain intuitive and well-structured. I also expect that 
                        handling CSS for different sections of my site will require better organisation as the project scales. Managing styles efficiently while keeping everything 
                        responsive and user-friendly will be an important skill to refine over time. Overall, I am confident that with continued practice, structuring content effectively 
                        and applying semantic markup will become second nature. This experience has already deepened my understanding of web development principles, and I look forward 
                        to refining my site further in the coming weeks.

            <h2>4&#93 Refining My Website: Design, Accessibility, and Future Improvements</h2>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-10">10 March</time>
                <p>
                        As we continue learning about Interaction Design (IxD), User Experience (UX), and User Interface (UI) processes, 
                        I am now focusing on developing my site’s overall structure rather than just its physical content in HTML. 
                        The way a website is designed plays a crucial role in how it is perceived, so I am putting considerable thought into this aspect.

                        My favourite websites are those that strike a balance between accessibility and functionality. 
                        They present information efficiently while ensuring smooth navigation. I appreciate sites that incorporate 
                        call-to-action elements without excessive loading times between interactions. Inspired by this, I plan to 
                        structure my website so that more content is available on a single page, minimising the need for users to 
                        navigate back and forth. To maintain clarity, I will incorporate dropdown menus and navigation bars, making 
                        it easier to find specific sections without overwhelming the user with too much information at once. 
                        This approach ensures a seamless experience while reducing frustration caused by excessive page loads.

                        Since this is a CV/portfolio website, it is essential that information about my qualifications, projects, 
                        and personality is easily accessible to potential employers. I am aiming for a minimalistic aesthetic 
                        while incorporating a vaporwave-inspired colour palette.

                        Rather than adopting vaporwave’s abstract UI elements, I am primarily focusing on its colour scheme—soft 
                        blues, pinks, purples, and greens as primary colours, with yellows and oranges as secondary accents. 
                        This combination allows me to create strong contrast, ensuring readability while also conveying a warm and 
                        inviting atmosphere. I believe these colours reflect both my technical and artistic sensibilities.

                        To improve usability, I will use large text and buttons. This makes navigation easier for users who 
                        may not be tech-savvy or have difficulty with precise mouse movements.

                        Additionally, my button designs will be neutral in shape—professional yet friendly—to reflect my serious 
                        approach to my career while maintaining an approachable personality.

                        Looking back at my original wireframes, I now have a much clearer vision of my website’s design. 
                        While the homepage structure remains similar to my initial concept, I will be incorporating more 
                        information and visuals to enhance engagement. My style guide is still in progress, but my design choices 
                        are now more intentional and aligned with my goals.

                        One of my biggest challenges has been organising my blog page. This required the most semantic markup 
                        and careful structuring. Initially, elements like article, time, and section tags seemed unnecessary, 
                        but I now understand their importance in improving readability and SEO. I am particularly proud of how I 
                        have applied semantic HTML across my site, making the information more structured and accessible.

                        Moving forward, I plan to refine my content to be more CV/portfolio-specific rather than placeholders 
                        for images and generic text. As I continue learning JavaScript and CSS, I aim to enhance interactivity 
                        and polish the overall visual experience. My goal is to create a professional yet personal space that 
                        effectively showcases my skills and personality to potential employers.
