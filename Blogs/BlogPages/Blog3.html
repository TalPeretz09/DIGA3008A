                <div class="e-content">
                        <h3>Creating a Professional and Accessible Experience</h3>
                        <p>
                        For my portfolio website, my primary target audience is potential employers. The main goal is to make it easy for them 
                        to navigate the site and quickly access relevant information about my skills, background, and education. To achieve this, 
                        the site will have a minimal and sleek design, using simple fonts, structured layouts, and a good amount of white 
                        space to prevent clutter. A clean and professional aesthetic ensures that the focus remains on my content without overwhelming the user. 
                        Since potential employers are often looking for specific qualifications or experience, it is crucial that all key 
                        information is easily accessible and clearly presented without unnecessary distractions.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Website Structure and Content</h3>
                        <p>
                        The website will primarily contain text, with images showcasing my designs and a professional picture of myself. 
                        It will consist of the following main pages: a home page that serves as the entry point, providing an overview of my site; 
                        an about me page containing details about my education, skills, and professional background; a designs page displaying my portfolio pieces, 
                        highlighting my creative and technical abilities; a blogs page featuring all the blogs that I would have written over the span of the 
                        course ;and a contact page that provides a simple way for employers or collaborators to reach out to me. Each of these pages is crucial 
                        for showcasing my professional qualifications in a structured and digestible manner. Since all of these pages serve a specific purpose, 
                        they must be designed in a way that encourages visitors to explore further rather than feeling overwhelmed by too much content at once.
                        </p>

                        <h3>User Journey and Navigation Flow</h3>
                        <p>
                        The intended user journey starts with the homepage, where visitors get an overview of who I am. From there, they can navigate through 
                        the other pages in a logical left-to-right order: first, they learn about my background on the About Me page, then explore my work 
                        samples in the Designs section, followed by insights into my thought process and expertise in the Blogs section, and finally, 
                        the Contact page enables them to reach out. This order is intentional, as it first provides essential background information before 
                        showcasing my actual work and thoughts, ensuring that employers get a complete picture before deciding to reach out. To enhance user flow, 
                        I could also implement guided interactions such as breadcrumb navigation to help users track their position on the site, buttons on each page 
                        that direct users toward the next logical step, and hover and animation effects that subtly guide user attention without being distracting. 
                        Ensuring that the navigation experience is seamless and intuitive is essential, as frustration with site usability may lead visitors to leave 
                        before reaching the most critical content.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Key Interface and Accessibility features</h3>
                        <p>
                        The primary interface element will be a navigation bar that allows smooth transitions between pages. Other elements include buttons for 
                        clear access and navigation, forms on the Contact page for easy communication, search functionality to help users find blog content efficiently, 
                        contrast and readability improvements for accessibility, and alt text for images to assist visually impaired users. I also want to consider 
                        other accessibility measures, such as ensuring proper color contrast, potential keyboard navigation support, and structuring my HTML to be 
                        screen-reader friendly. Making my site accessible is not just about inclusivity; it also improves usability for all users and contributes to a better overall experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Implementing Semantic SEO and HTML</h3>
                        <p>
                        My website follows a simple URL scheme where each page extends from the root homepage (e.g., mysite.com/about). The file names are intuitive, 
                        making it easy for users to understand their location within the site. Implementing semantic HTML has been an insightful learning experience. 
                        By using elements like for blogs, for structuring content, and for date-related elements, I have improved my website's SEO and accessibility. 
                        Understanding how search engines prioritize content has made me more mindful of structuring my site effectively. Before learning about semantic markup, 
                        I had not realized how much of a role it plays in improving search engine visibility. Now that I have started implementing these principles, 
                        I feel more confident about making my site not only well-structured but also optimized for discoverability.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Challenges and Learning Experiences</h3>
                        <p>
                        This week, I focused on implementing my blog page while incorporating more semantic markup. Although semantic HTML is straightforward, I anticipate 
                        that as my website grows, organising sections and maintaining a clean structure will become more complex. Additionally, integrating CSS and JavaScript 
                        will be an ongoing learning process, particularly in ensuring that styling and interactivity remain intuitive and well-structured. I also expect that 
                        handling CSS for different sections of my site will require better organisation as the project scales. Managing styles efficiently while keeping everything 
                        responsive and user-friendly will be an important skill to refine over time. Overall, I am confident that with continued practice, structuring content effectively 
                        and applying semantic markup will become second nature. This experience has already deepened my understanding of web development principles, and I look forward 
                        to refining my site further in the coming weeks.
