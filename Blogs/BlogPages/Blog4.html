                        <p>
                        As we continue learning about Interaction Design (IxD), User Experience (UX), and User Interface (UI) processes, 
                        I am now focusing on developing my site's overall structure rather than just its physical content in HTML. 
                        The way a website is designed plays a crucial role in how it is perceived, so I am putting considerable thought into this aspect.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Navigability and User Experience</h3>
                        <p>
                        My favourite websites are those that strike a balance between accessibility and functionality. 
                        They present information efficiently while ensuring smooth navigation. I appreciate sites that incorporate 
                        call-to-action elements without excessive loading times between interactions. Inspired by this, I plan to 
                        structure my website so that more content is available on a single page, minimising the need for users to 
                        navigate back and forth. To maintain clarity, I will incorporate dropdown menus and navigation bars, making 
                        it easier to find specific sections without overwhelming the user with too much information at once. 
                        This approach ensures a seamless experience while reducing frustration caused by excessive page loads.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Aesthetic Choices and Branding</h3>
                        <p>
                        Since this is a CV/portfolio website, it is essential that information about my qualifications, projects, 
                        and personality is easily accessible to potential employers. I am aiming for a minimalistic aesthetic 
                        while incorporating a vaporwave-inspired colour palette.
                        </p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../Images/VaporwavePallete.png" alt="Vaporwave Colour Palette">
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>
                        Rather than adopting vaporwave's abstract UI elements, I am primarily focusing on its colour scheme—soft 
                        blues, pinks, purples, and greens as primary colours, with yellows and oranges as secondary accents. 
                        This combination allows me to create strong contrast, ensuring readability while also conveying a warm and 
                        inviting atmosphere. I believe these colours reflect both my technical and artistic sensibilities.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
                        <p>
                        To improve usability, I will use large text and buttons. This makes navigation easier for users who 
                        may not be tech-savvy or have difficulty with precise mouse movements.
                        </p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../Images/ActionButton.png" alt="Action Button">
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                        Additionally, my button designs will be neutral in shape—professional yet friendly—to reflect my serious 
                        approach to my career while maintaining an approachable personality.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Reflection on my Initial Wireframes</h3>
                        <p>
                        Looking back at my original wireframes, I now have a much clearer vision of my website's design. 
                        While the homepage structure remains similar to my initial concept, I will be incorporating more 
                        information and visuals to enhance engagement. My style guide is still in progress, but my design choices 
                        are now more intentional and aligned with my goals.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Challenges and Achievements</h3>
                        <p>
                        One of my biggest challenges has been organising my blog page. This required the most semantic markup 
                        and careful structuring. Initially, elements like article, time, and section tags seemed unnecessary, 
                        but I now understand their importance in improving readability and SEO. I am particularly proud of how I 
                        have applied semantic HTML across my site, making the information more structured and accessible.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                        <p>
                        Moving forward, I plan to refine my content to be more CV/portfolio-specific rather than placeholders 
                        for images and generic text. As I continue learning JavaScript and CSS, I aim to enhance interactivity 
                        and polish the overall visual experience. My goal is to create a professional yet personal space that 
                        effectively showcases my skills and personality to potential employers.
                        </p>
