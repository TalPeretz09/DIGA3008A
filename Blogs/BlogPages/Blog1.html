                    <h3>My Initial Understanding of the Web</h3>
                    <p>
                    I have always taken the web for granted. My initial understanding of it was quite rudimentary—
                    I knew about web browsers, search engines, webpages, and websites, but I never fully understood 
                    how they functioned behind the scenes. Going into this course, my primary goal was simply to 
                    learn how to make a website, which I saw as an opportunity to improve my understanding of programming 
                    languages like HTML and JavaScript. I have some prior HTML and JavaScript experience from my school 
                    education, however, it was very basic. After setting up GitHub Pages and creating my first HTML document, 
                    my perspective on website creation has already begun to shift.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Simplicity of The Early Web</h3>
                    <p>
                    Something I found particularly fascinating about the history of the web is just how simple it was 
                    at the beginning. Tim Berners-Lee's 1994 paper, The World-Wide Web, describes how the web was 
                    initially envisioned as a way to link documents together and allow researchers to share information 
                    (Berners-Lee et al., 1994). The early web was purely text-based, and even features we now consider fundamental, 
                    such as images and videos, came much later. The timeline of web history further highlights this progression—
                    CSS was introduced in 1996 to improve the presentation of webpages, JavaScript followed shortly after to 
                    enable interactivity, and Web 2.0 brought about user-generated content and social media in the early 2000s 
                    (The History of the Web, n.d.). Seeing this timeline made me realize how far we have come in making the 
                    web more accessible, organized, and dynamic.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Discovering the Power of GitHub Pages</h3>
                    <p>
                    Setting up GitHub Pages reinforced this for me. Although I had never used the Pages feature before, 
                    I was surprised by how quickly I was able to get it running. The process took only a few minutes, 
                    and it immediately made sense why so many developers use version control systems like GitHub to manage websites. 
                    Due to my underestimation of the time, effort and resources required to build a website, I was initially 
                    under the impression that using GitHub to manage my website would be unnecessary. However, I now realise 
                    how the ability to update a site continuously and track changes in real-time is incredibly powerful, 
                    especially with how many different components can go into a single site. I can already see how this 
                    workflow will be valuable for future projects, and I look forward to working with it more.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Impact of The Browser Wars</h3>
                    <p>
                    Another aspect of web history that caught my attention was the browser wars. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, 
                    companies like Microsoft and Netscape competed to dominate the browser market. Internet Explorer ultimately won that battle, 
                    but the introduction of new competitors, like Firefox and Chrome, reshaped the landscape once again (Popular Mechanics, 2019). 
                    This period of competition led to rapid advancements in browser capabilities, which significantly influenced how websites are 
                    built today. Thinking about this in relation to my own experience, it's remarkable how much easier web development has become. 
                    Modern browsers now support a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it possible to create highly 
                    interactive and responsive websites with relatively little effort.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Future of the Web: Where Do We Go from Here?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Looking ahead, I find myself wondering what the future of the web holds. AI has already become deeply 
                    integrated into search engine optimization and targeted advertising, making content delivery more precise 
                    than ever before. Could AI one day be so advanced that any user can instantly find exactly what they need with near-perfect accuracy? 
                    The web has evolved at an astonishing pace over the past 35 years, and it will be exciting to see how emerging technologies continue to shape it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Goals for Learning Web Development</h3>
                    <p>
                    Through this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of how websites are structured and organized behind the scenes. 
                    I want to explore how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create dynamic and visually engaging sites. 
                    While I now appreciate how much effort goes into even the simplest webpages, I also recognize how accessible 
                    web development has become. With the right tools and resources, anyone can build something meaningful on the web, 
                    and I am eager to continue learning and creating.
                    </p>
