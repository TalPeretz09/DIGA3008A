                    <h3>Summary & First Impressions</h3>
                    <p>
                        In "Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data," Christoph Lutz shows how digital inequality is changing alongside the increase of new technologies like AI, big data, and smart systems. He uses a framework made up of three levels of the digital divide: the first-level (access to technology), the second-level (skills and usage), and the third-level (outcomes and benefits). Lutz argues that while access is still a problem, especially in underprivileged communities, the more pressing issue is how technology ends up reinforcing and emulating existing social divides. New platforms and systems might look like progress on the surface, but they often leave behind the people who are already at a disadvantage.
                        One thing that stood out to me was the idea that not all internet access is equal. Lutz points out how people who rely on mobile-only access-common in lower-income groups-are limited in what they can do online. That limitation ends up deepening inequality (Selwyn, 2010). I also found his metaphor about “walled gardens” turning into “prison yards” really powerful-it captures how closed-off and controlled these platforms are becoming. The article brings together a lot of academic research, but it still feels very relevant to everyday life, especially when it talks about things like smart speakers not recognising certain accents, or gig workers being controlled by hidden algorithms (Eubanks, 2018).
                        Personally, I found the article genuinely inspiring. Lutz's focus on how digital divides reflect broader social inequalities is something I care about and hope to work on in the future once I'm out in the industry. Living in South Africa, I see these divides every day. So many people here still don't have reliable access to the internet or even basic tech-which, in today's world, feels like something everyone should have (Gillwald et al., 2021). I touched on this in a previous blog post about Kapasis' article on the digital divide during COVID-19, where he argued that digital access is becoming a basic human right (Kapasis S, 2020). Something that really surprised me in Lutz's article was the way he challenged the old belief that technology would naturally bring about more equality. I'd always kind of assumed that too-technology connects people, right? But the reality is that it also separates us more and more, especially if access, literacy, and outcomes are so uneven (van Dijk, 2020). It made me more aware of just how much digital inequality affects people's lives. And honestly, I find it quite frustrating. Something that's meant to bring people together is instead pushing us further apart. As a white, upper-class man, I know I have a lot of privilege when it comes to access and opportunity-but I also feel a responsibility to use that position to help change things.

                    <h3>Critical Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>
                       I strongly agree with Lutz's argument that digital technologies often deepen inequality. As our reliance on technology grows, so does the gap between those who can benefit from it and those who are excluded. The purpose of technology is to improve life-make things faster, easier, more efficient-but this also means that when essential services go digital, people who don't have access are pushed even further to the margins. As Lutz points out, even in wealthier countries, certain groups-like the elderly, rural populations, and those with lower levels of education-still struggle with access. That stuck with me, because it shows that inequality isn't only a “developing country” issue; it's embedded across the board (Hargittai, 2002).
                       I also agree with the idea that technology tends to reflect social structures rather than transform them. People who are already financially secure are far more likely to afford devices, pay for internet, and take advantage of services like online shopping, education, or transport apps. Meanwhile, those with fewer resources are locked out of these systems and continue to fall behind. In that way, technology often reinforces the same power dynamics that already exist.
                       As a game design and engineering student, I do believe tools can be redesigned to work more equitably-but at the same time, there are real infrastructural challenges. It's not enough to just hand out devices if there's no internet to connect to. For places outside of major cities-like many rural communities in South Africa-this means building physical infrastructure like broadband cables or mobile towers. That's a huge economic and logistical task. Still, I'm optimistic. No one imagined just how important digital technology would become to everyday life, and yet here we are. That tells me it's possible we'll eventually get to a point where the entire world is connected, and where digital systems are designed not only for the privileged, but for everyone.

                    <h3>Personal Context & Framework</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because my studies rely so heavily on technology, I'm constantly confronted with the role it plays in society-and how unequal access to it can be. Even in something like game design, which is often seen as entertainment focused, I've realised that the games I create might not be accessible to everyone due to device limitations or internet requirements. That's a design limitation I want to challenge. On the engineering side, I see more potential to actually help bridge the digital divide-by creating electronics or systems that can bring access to education, finance, entertainment, shopping, and more, especially to communities that are currently excluded.
                        This article made me think more seriously about designing not just for innovation or profit, but for inclusion. I want to build more accessible, inclusive systems and games that make the benefits of technology more widely available-so that people from all backgrounds can experience the value it brings. As I mentioned earlier, I come from a very privileged position, especially within the South African context. I have access to resources that many others around me simply don't. It's something I try to be conscious of, and rather than take that for granted, I want to use it as a driving force to create work that improves the lives of people who've been excluded by digital systems-whether through lack of infrastructure, income, or opportunity.

                    <h3>Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>
                        I found Lutz's article to be well-structured and grounded in a solid body of academic research. The framework of first-, second-, and third-level digital divides made it easier to understand the complexity of digital inequality and how it plays out across different dimensions of society. I particularly appreciated how the article didn't stay stuck in abstract theory-Lutz gave relevant, real-world examples, like the limitations of mobile internet access or the exclusion built into smart speakers, which helped make the ideas more tangible and relatable.
                        That said, some parts of the article felt quite dense and academic. At times, it assumed a certain level of background knowledge about digital sociology or theoretical frameworks, which could make it difficult for a reader who's new to the topic. As someone still learning in this field, I would have appreciated more actual/practical suggestions or case studies that show how digital inequality is being dealt with in real-world contexts. While the article does a great job highlighting the problems, it leaves the reader thinking about what can actually be done about them. Still, I think the article is quite valuable-it encourages people like me, who are training to work in tech and design, to start thinking more critically about the social consequences of the systems we help create.

                    <h3>Takeaways & Greater Relevance</h3>
                    <p>
                        This article reminded me that digital inequality isn't just about who has Wi-Fi-it's about who gets left out of the future. As someone going into tech and design, I see now that it's not enough to build exciting or efficient systems; we have to ask who benefits from them and who doesn't. Lutz's work has pushed me to think more critically about inclusion and to make sure that the tools I help create don't unintentionally deepen existing divides. If anything, this reflection has confirmed that addressing digital inequality should be part of any responsible approach to technology.
