                    <h3>Reflecting on Decolonialism in My Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I think about what decolonial coding means, I see it as a way of removing assumptions that are often baked into the systems and tools we use. For me, it's about making sure that what I create isn't just made for people who have access to fast internet, modern devices, or who speak English fluently. It's about thinking beyond the default and trying to be more inclusive of people who've historically been excluded from tech-whether that's through language, access, or cultural representation.
                        Looking at my own website, I can already see a few areas where I've made those kinds of assumptions. The whole site is only in English-I didn't even consider including other languages, which definitely limits who can engage with it. This website is of course an assignment for my Interactive Media course however that is definitely something I will consider if I choose to further develop this site. I've also designed and tested everything on a fast connection using a decent laptop, without really thinking about how it might perform on slower networks or older hardware.
                        Even the aesthetic I've gone for-vaporwave-comes from a specific online subculture that I like, but it might not connect with everyone. I use custom Google Fonts and high-res images too, which not everyone will be able to load easily. And I hadn't thought much about accessibility until we were given several lectures on that topic, so things like screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and alt text weren't necessarily on my radar when I started.
                        This whole idea of decolonial coding has pushed me to start thinking about who I'm really designing for, and how I can make my work more open and accessible-not just for people like me, but for as many people as possible.

                    <h3>Which Changes I'm Making to Incorporate JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I started adding JavaScript to my site, I began to see how powerful it is-not just for making things look cool, but for improving how people use and interact with the site. One of the first things I added was a “Back to Top” button, which helps with navigation, especially on my long blog, essay and design pages.
                        I am also building a gallery scroller so that visitors can swipe or click through image collections without the page getting super long or messy. This will make the layout cleaner and more interactive, which will be a big improvement.
                        Probably one of the most helpful things I am going to add is a hamburger menu for mobile screens. It keeps the navigation compact and easy to use on smaller devices, which is super important since a lot of people browse on their phones. I will also set up some filter buttons on my game and design pages, so users can quickly sort by category and find what they're actually interested in.
                        Making these features work means I have to restructure a few things in my HTML and get more comfortable linking and writing JavaScript files. It's been a bit of a learning curve, but I'm getting more confident with it.

                    <h3>How JavaScript Streamlines My Interaction Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript has helped me make the site feel more responsive and user-friendly. I am adding more hover effects that reveal short descriptions when you move your mouse over images. It's a small detail, but it gives visitors more info without needing to click around or load extra pages.
                        Another thing I've started working on is keyboard navigation-so people who don't use a mouse can still move through the site smoothly. That kind of accessibility is something I didn't think about early on, but now I'm trying to build it in from the start.
                        In general, JavaScript lets me create a more dynamic experience without sacrificing design. It helps keep users engaged, makes the site easier to navigate, and gives me more control over how everything flows. It's a work in progress, but I'm enjoying figuring out how to combine style, functionality, and accessibility.
