            <h2>[Who I Am]</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Tal Peretz, a 3rd-year student at the University of Witwatersrand, 
                studying Electrical Engineering in Digital Art. I’m passionate about all 
                things gaming—whether it’s game design, coding, art, or mechanics, I love 
                exploring the creative and technical sides of the industry.
            </p>

            <h2>[Why I Do This]</h2>
            <p>
                Gaming has always been a big part of my life, and I enjoy diving deep into 
                game design theory, programming, and visual aesthetics. I also love creating 
                fight stick art, combining my artistic and technical interests to create unique designs.
                I have also competed in and won several e-sports events. 
                My curiosity extends beyond gaming—I enjoy anime, manga, playing tennis, and learning random trivia.
            </p>

            <h2>[Where I'm Headed]</h2>
            <p>
                After my degree, I plan to travel and pursue a career in game design. I want to combine 
                my skills in engineering, coding, and digital art to contribute to the gaming industry in a meaningful way.
            </p>

            <h2>[What I'm Learning]</h2>
            <p>
                I have experience with C#, C++, and Java, but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are new to me. That’s why I’m excited 
                about this Interactive Media course. While it’s a compulsory part of my degree, it’s also one of the courses 
                I enjoy the most! Learning web development opens up new creative possibilities for me, and I look forward to 
                applying these skills in my future projects.
            </p>

            <h2>[How This Website Fits In]</h2>
            <p>
                This website started as part of my Interactive Media coursework, but I plan to continue updating it as a personal portfolio. 
                It will showcase my projects, designs, and experiences, evolving as I grow in my career.
