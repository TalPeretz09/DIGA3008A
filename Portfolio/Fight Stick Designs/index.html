                This fight stick is based on Katakuri from One Piece. The main image shows him holding his spear 
                while reaching for a donut, showing both his strength and love for sweets. The Big Mom Pirates' 
                Jolly Roger is also included, along with a small chibi version of Katakuri to add a fun and cute touch. 
                The design mixes his serious side with his sweet and silly moments.

                This fight stick design features Bepo, the lovable polar bear from the Heart Pirates. 
                It includes a big image of him in his orange jumpsuit, the Heart Pirates' jolly roger,
                and a couple different versions of Bepo. The design captures his loyal and calm personality, 
                with a fun and lighthearted look.

            <p class="p-summary">
                This fight stick is a collage of Mii-kun from How to Keep a Mummy, showing him 
                in different adorable scenes. His tiny size, big eyes, and cuddly charm make 
                this design all about cuteness. Mii-kun is in my opinion the cutest anime character, 
                and I wanted the stick to capture just how lovable he is.

            <p class="p-summary">
                This fight stick features Android 17 from Dragon Ball, with a striking image 
                of him shooting a ki blast. His name in Japanese and the Red Ribbon Army logo 
                highlight his origins, while the forest background reflects his current life 
                as a forest ranger. It's a cool and clean design that captures both his strength and calm nature.

            <p class="p-summary">
                This fight stick embraces a full vaporwave aesthetic, with bold pink and blue tones throughout. 
                It mixes Japanese and Greek imagery, giving it an artistic and nostalgic feel. CGI dolphins, 
                a retro Windows error message, and that classic 80s digital vibe bring it all together for a dreamy, 
                glitchy throwback look.
